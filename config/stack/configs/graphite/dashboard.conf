# This configuration file controls the behavior of the Dashboard UI, available
# at http://my-graphite-server/dashboard/.
#
# This file must contain a [ui] section that defines the following settings:
#
[ui]
default_graph_width = 400
default_graph_height = 250
automatic_variants = true
refresh_interval = 60

theme = default
#
# These settings apply to the UI as a whole, all other sections in this file
# pertain only to specific metric types.
#
# The dashboard presents only metrics that fall into specified naming schemes
# defined in this file. This creates a simpler, more targetted view of the
# data. The general form for defining a naming scheme is as follows:
#
[System]
scheme = system
#field1.label = loadavg_15min
#field2.label = Bar
#
#
# Where each <field> will be displayed as a dropdown box
# in the UI and the remaining portion of the namespace
# shown in the Metric Selector panel. The .label options set the labels
# displayed for each dropdown.
#
# For example:
#
#[Sales]
#scheme = sales.<channel>.<type>.<brand>
#channel.label = Channel
#type.label = Product Type
#brand.label = Brand
#
# This defines a 'Sales' metric type that uses 3 dropdowns in the Context Selector
# (the upper-left panel) while any deeper metrics (per-product counts or revenue, etc)
# will be available in the Metric Selector (upper-right panel).
